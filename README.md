The short version
--

Where On Earth (WOE) data for countries smushed up with Natural Earth (NE) data
for countries. That's fancy talk for "polygons".

The longer version
--

It's still a bit of a moving target, specifically formatting and normalizing ket
names in the `properties` hash. For example, all the NE property keys are
prefixed with `ne:`. Most but not all the records have NE geometries associated
with them.

Things like the ["Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"](https://github.com/straup/whereonearth-country/blob/master/data/248/656/98/24865698.json)
which ... uh ... uh, well yeah. This is why we still have wars and stuff, isn't
it? Those are the kinds of fiddly details that still need to be worked out.

Suggestions and gentle cluebats are absolutely welcome.

Where possible corresponding Wikipedia page IDs have been added. I'd also really
like to include Geonames IDs since that would be both easy and useful. Please
for to be sending me a pull request if you've already got that data at hand.

The long version

I still need to write it.
