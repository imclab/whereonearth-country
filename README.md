The short version
--

Where On Earth (WOE) data for countries smushed up with Natural Earth data for
countries. That's fancy talk for "polygons".

The longer version
--

It's still a bit of a moving target, specifically formatting and normalizing ket
names in the `properties` hash. For example, all the Natural Earth property keys
are prefixed with `ne:`.

Also I'd really like to include Geonames IDs since that would be both easy and
useful. Please for to be sending me a pull request if you've already got that
data at hand.

The long version
--

I still need to write it.
